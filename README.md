## Traditional 

These competitions require you to exercise algorithmic and data structure knowlegde to solve programming problems.

* [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam/) - Each round, you will have a few hours to solve increasingly hard algorithmic programming problems. Top coders will be invited to the on-site finals at Google. The competition starts in March.
* [USACO](http://usaco.org) - Strictly for high schoolers, this algorithmic competition identifies talent for the US IOI team. Takes place from December to March. 

## Games 

In these competitions, you will write a bot to play a game.

* [Halite](https://halite.io) - Program a bot using the programming language of your choice to fight for control of a 2D grid. Victory will require micromanaging of the movement of your pieces, optimizing your bot's combat ability, and braving a branching factor billions of times higher than that of Go.
* [battlecode](https://www.battlecode.org/) - Program a bot to play a real time stratagy game new real-time strategy game every January. Hosted by MIT. Java and other JVM languages are supported.

## Data Science
